User: I want to make homemade pasta for the first time. What kind of flour should I use?

Assistant: For traditional Italian pasta, you'll want tipo 00 flour. It's finely milled and creates a silky, smooth texture. You can also use all-purpose flour if that's what you have - it works fine, just slightly different texture.

User: I only have all-purpose. Will that work okay?

Assistant: Absolutely! All-purpose flour makes great fresh pasta. You'll use about 100 grams of flour per egg. The basic ratio is 1 egg to 100g flour, but you can adjust based on how the dough feels.

User: How do I know when the dough is ready?

Assistant: The dough should be smooth and elastic, not sticky. After kneading for about 10 minutes, it should spring back when you poke it. Let it rest for 30 minutes wrapped in plastic - this relaxes the gluten and makes rolling easier.

User: Can I use a rolling pin or do I need a pasta machine?

Assistant: You can definitely use a rolling pin! It takes more effort, but it's how pasta was made for centuries. Roll from the center outward, rotating the dough frequently. Aim for about 1/16 inch thickness - you should almost be able to see your hand through it.

User: What shapes are easiest for beginners?

Assistant: Fettuccine or pappardelle are great starter shapes - just cut the rolled dough into ribbons. Fettuccine is about 1/4 inch wide, pappardelle is wider at 3/4 to 1 inch. Farfalle (bow ties) are also fun and forgiving.

User: Speaking of Italian food, what wine pairs well with pasta?

Assistant: It depends on the sauce! Light tomato sauces pair beautifully with Chianti. Creamy sauces like carbonara go well with crisp white wines like Pinot Grigio. The key is matching the wine's weight to the sauce's richness.

User: I'm making a simple tomato basil sauce.

Assistant: Perfect! A medium-bodied Italian red like Chianti or Sangiovese would be lovely. The acidity in the wine complements the tomatoes, and the herbal notes work beautifully with the basil.

User: How long does fresh pasta take to cook?

Assistant: Much faster than dried pasta - usually just 2-3 minutes in boiling salted water. Fresh pasta is done when it floats to the surface and has a tender bite. Start checking at 2 minutes.

User: Should I add oil to the cooking water?

Assistant: That's a common myth actually - you don't need oil in the water. It can actually prevent sauce from adhering to the pasta. Just use plenty of salted water (should taste like the sea) and stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

User: How much salt are we talking?

Assistant: About 1-2 tablespoons of salt per 4-6 quarts of water. It seems like a lot, but most of it stays in the water. This is your only chance to season the pasta itself from the inside.
